## What is Routing Algorithm?
A routing algorithm is a method used by routers to determine the most efficient path for forwarding packets from a source to a destination in a network. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines its destination IP address, consults its routing table, and applies the routing algorithm to select the best possible path based on metrics like hop count, bandwidth, delay, and link cost.
