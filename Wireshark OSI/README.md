# Analyzing Network Packets Using Wireshark to Identify Layers in the OSI Model
## Introduction
The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to teach the functionality and services of internet communication. It divides communication into 7 layers and explains how each layer works with the help of protocols. In this lab, we will use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic at each layer of the OSI model.

### What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is an open-source software used to analyze packets in a network. It captures and inspects network traffic in real-time, allowing users to examine the details of data packets sent between devices. Wireshark provides a graphical user interface that helps users view and interpret the data flowing across a network. It supports a wide range of network protocols and can decode and display detailed information about each packet, including headers, payload, and protocol-specific details.
